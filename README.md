# zeroforums website system version 1.0 #

Current version: V1.1

### More about zeroforums V1.0 ###
* zeroforums (including version 1 and any other future versions) is a completely free, open source, website and forums system to be used for gaming communities.
* zeroforums version 1 will include a basic forums system, a basic usertag/permissions system, and a basic news board system. Potentionally even a forum thread voting system (if not in version 1, then in version 2)
* work on zeroforums version 2 can be expected to begin when version 1 is complete and stable. zeroforums version 2 will include everything from version 1, but also better security, a more advanced and flexible usertags system with support for multiple usertags per user, a much more complex forums system with more functionallity and flexibilty, and more to come.

### How do I get set up? ###

* You need a MySQL database
* Change /phpscripts/getsql.php accordingly to your MySQL configuration.
* Run website, then go to page /phpscripts/createdefault. This will create all the PHP databases, initiate basic information such as default links and usertags, and will generate the default admin account with the username = "admin" and the password = "admin". Log onto this account and change the password (and username if you would like) as soon as possible or your website will be vulnerable!

### Who can I talk to? ###

* Me (ZeroByter)
